        <title>Principles used to achieve true TDD</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Sky Store started out, the web development team had the requirement of getting something out on the market as quickly as possible. This meant a few important things suffered, primarily the testing strategy. In this post I’m going to talk a bit about how the team took our AngularJS from extremely limited unit test coverage, to it’s current approach of following a pure TDD approach. Most of the points mentioned here are applicable to virtually any codebase, not specifically Angular.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Maintaining code quality in Sky Store web</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many different views on code style and how to maintain it, but the consensus in our team was that within reason, we should be able to take a piece of code and not be able to identify who wrote it. These are the tools and practices we use to try and achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
