I'm Christopher Cook, a Front End Developer currently working at Sky. I specialise in AngularJS and ReactJS development. I'm particularly keen on Test Driven Development.

I'm also the Javascript Community Lead at Sky, which involves ensuring there's a thriving community including workshops, regular talks and blogging. I've given talks on subjects including TDD and using React and Redux. I also gave a talk about ReactJS component resusability at the London React User Group February 2016.
